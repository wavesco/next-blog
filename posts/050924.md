This blog is a demonstration of deploying a Next JS Web Application to Vercel with source control and setting up a custom domain. Google PageSpeed Insights reports great numbers across the board in Performance, Accessibilitiy, Best Practices, and Search Engine Optimization. I implemented a few libraries to help elevate the UX, and keep it relatively simple while being dynamic. I'm looking to implement more features on the backend.
