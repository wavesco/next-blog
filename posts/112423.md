As an enthusiast in game development, I've recently embarked on creating a dynamic day/night cycle in Unreal Engine. 

This feature is not just a visual enhancement; it's a transformative element that brings a new level of immersion to games. It's a feature that can significantly impact the gaming experience, offering realism and an evolving game environment.

It's current features include, geographically accurate sun positioning, dynamic length of day, and custom texture implementations.
