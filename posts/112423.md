Welcome to my latest project update! As an enthusiast in game development, I'm going to be posting short proof of concepts I'm currently working on. I've recently embarked on an exciting journey - creating a dynamic day/night cycle in Unreal Engine. 

This feature is not just a visual enhancement; it's a transformative element that brings a new level of immersion to games. It's a feature that can significantly impact the gaming experience, offering realism and an ever-changing game environment.

It's current features include, geographically accurate sun positioning, dynamic length of day, and custom sun/moon, and star texture implementations.
